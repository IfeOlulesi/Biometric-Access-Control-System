BUGS:
  -> What happens when the student has no record i.e. no tracker attached to that student
  -> Is it possible to make the fingerprint scanner always ready to scan....the light always on?

  1. Lots of refactoring to be done in views.py
  2. Need to alter the fingerprint storage system - possible failure here in the future

  3. Except errors when invalid base64 comes in
  4. Actually, make that box readonly....in fact invincible
  5. In result.js, change the URL...[just do something about it]
